In 2017 Banco Santander launched its Santander X initiative, which was born with the aim of becoming the largest university entrepreneurship ecosystem in the world.
Banco Santander and different universities create Santander X, the world's largest platform for university entrepreneurship.
It is a collaborative network in which universities and entrepreneurs from all over the world can collaborate, share ideas and knowledge, and even attract investment and from where Santander universities publishes the aid and subsidies to these projects, together with the rest of the collaborating organizations.

We want to analyze the data of the calls for aid that it publishes in its Santander x portal.
Data on which are the organizations or entities with which Santander universities collaborates the most, impact by the number of beneficiaries, types of projects or stages in which the investment is focused together with the estimation of the capital mobilized in this platform, are some of the questions that we try to answer with this analysis.

In addition to other more technical aspects, such as how to obtain data from the different websites that use javascript to display data locally, it does "not always happen to scrape" with selenium, they are other objectives of this notebook.
